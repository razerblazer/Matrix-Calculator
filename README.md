# Matrix-Calculator

I am currently taking a linear algebra course and decided to see if I could create a basic matrix calculator that was user friendly. Most of the explaination of the different parts of the code is inside the comments inside of the code. In a nutshell, the calculator asks the user for the size of the matrices that it will be working with and checks to make sure that it is a possible operation. Then it will ask the user for the entries of the matrix in its respective positions one at a time.
